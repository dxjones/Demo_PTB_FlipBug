Hardware:

iMac "Late 2012", OSX 10.8.5
2.7 GHz i5, 8 GB ram, NVIDIA GT 640M 512MB vram
PsychtoolboxVersion 3.0.12 - Flavor: beta - Corresponds to SVN Revision 5727
screen resolution = 1920 x 1080

For this iMac, Screen('Flip') seem reliable when wait an extra 0, 1, or 2 FlipIntervals.

When wait for 3, 4, or 5 FlipIntervals, Screen('Flip') becomes increasingly unreliable.

This systematic connection with time suggests
there is an error in the logic of Screen('Flip').
